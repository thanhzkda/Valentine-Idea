INSTRUCTIONS FOR ADDING YOUR OWN MEDIA:

1. Place your photos in the 'media/photos/' folder

3. Update the objects above with:
   - Correct file names (e.g., 'media/photos/our_first_date.jpg')

   - Real titles
   - Actual dates
   - Personal descriptions

4. Tips:
   - Optimize images (resize to max 1920px width, compress to <500KB each)
   - Thumbnails should be ~400px wide for good 3D performance
   - Compress videos (use H.264 codec, 720p resolution, <10MB each)
   - Use consistent naming: no spaces, lowercase, underscores
   - Supported formats: JPG, PNG for images / MP4 for videos
   - For videos, the thumbnail is used as the frame on the 3D heart

5. You can add or remove items from this array as needed
